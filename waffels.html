<p align="center">Waffles are a beloved dish enjoyed across the world. Made from a batter of flour, eggs, milk, and butter, they are cooked in a special iron that gives them their signature grid pattern. Originating in Belgium, waffles have spread globally, taking on many variations such as the thick Belgian waffle, the chewy Liege waffle, and the bubble-shaped Hong Kong egg waffle. Today, they are eaten both sweet and savory, topped with syrup, fruit, chocolate, or even fried chicken, making them one of the most versatile comfort foods</p>
